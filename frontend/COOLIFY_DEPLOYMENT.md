- [x] Production environment variables configured
- [x] Dockerfile optimized for production
- [x] Vite config supports flexible hosting
- [x] Build optimization enabled

## üîß Coolify Configuration

### Application Settings

```yaml
Name: nlp-frontend
Application Type: Git Repository
Repository: ankitpokhrel08/nlp_project
Branch: main
Base Directory: frontend
Build Pack: Docker
Port: 8009
Health Check URL: /
```

### Environment Variables

Set these in the Coolify UI under Environment Variables:

```env
# Core Configuration
PORT=8009
NODE_ENV=production

# API Configuration (Direct to backend - no proxy needed)
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://nlp-backend.itclub.asmitphuyal.com.np

# Build Configuration
VITE_BUILD_MODE=production
```

### Domain Configuration

1. Set your custom domain in Coolify
2. Enable SSL (handled automatically by Coolify)
3. Ensure HTTPS is enforced

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

1. **Push to Repository**
   ```bash

   git commit -m "feat: optimize frontend for Coolify deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Create Application in Coolify**
   - Login to your Coolify dashboard
   - Create new application with settings above
   - Set environment variables

3. **Deploy**
   - Trigger deployment from Coolify UI
   - Monitor build logs
   - Verify deployment success

## üîç Verification

After deployment, verify:

- [ ] Frontend loads successfully
- [ ] API calls work to backend
- [ ] All models are accessible (lemmatizer, NER, stemmer, aspect)
- [ ] SSL certificate is valid
- [ ] Responsive design works

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Features for Coolify

- **Flexible Host Support**: `allowedHosts: "all"` for any domain

## üîß Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check environment variables** in Coolify UI
2. **Verify backend connectivity** by testing API endpoints
3. **Review build logs** in Coolify dashboard
4. **Check SSL certificates** are valid
