# üß† Nepali NLP Hub - Interactive Language Processing Platform

A comprehensive web platform showcasing cutting-edge Natural Language Processing models specifically designed for the Nepali language. This project serves as both a demonstration platform and a practical tool for researchers, developers, and enthusiasts working with Nepali text processing.

## üéØ Why This Project?

The Nepali language, spoken by over 30 million people worldwide, has been underrepresented in the field of Natural Language Processing. This platform aims to:

- **Bridge the Language Gap**: Provide accessible NLP tools for Nepali speakers
- **Showcase Research**: Demonstrate state-of-the-art Nepali language models
- **Enable Innovation**: Offer a platform for researchers to share their work
- **Educational Purpose**: Help students and developers learn about NLP in Nepali context
- **Community Building**: Foster collaboration in Nepali NLP research

Built with modern web technologies, this platform provides an intuitive interface for interacting with various Nepali NLP models through real-time chat interfaces.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v16 or higher)
